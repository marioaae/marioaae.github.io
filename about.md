Hello! I am a Software Engineer on his way to become a Full Stack Web Developer.

In this personal website I will document my technical journey mainly for my own
future reference but making it public for anybody who finds it useful.

I currently have a full-time job in the Pharma industry and I develop digital
services (of my own) on the side.
