I decided to start a technical blog to document and make public my journey into
building digital products with different technologies. The typical options came
to my mind like WordPress, Blogger, Medium, etc. At the end I chose
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and although at the time of writing this,
I'm at the very beginning of my journey with it, I'm very satisfied with it so far.

# What is Jekyll?

As stated in the official [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) website:

> Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written
in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static
website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look,
what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.

This means that you don't have to create server-side code (e.g. PHP) and other
server-side technologies to create the site. All you write is text formatted in
[markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) which is very simple and Jekyll
will do the dirty job of processing it and delivering html files that will
ultimately be your website.

Although Jekyll is very simple and easy to use, I consider it suitable for people
with some sort of software technical background, otherwise probably some of the
other popular options is a better fit.

Here are what I consider the pros and cons of Jekyll

# Pros
- Writing content in markdown makes it very easy to do formatting supporting for
things like quoting, code snippets, and so on. Plus the outcome feels very clean.
- It is free under an [MIT License](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/LICENSE).
- Free hosting at GitHub (with GitHub pages) and you even get the option to configure
your custom domain name for free (you have to buy the domain name with a DNS provider).
- If used in combination with GitHub pages, by definition it is being versioned
from start since the host is literally a GitHub repository.
- Themes can be easily installed
- There are several plug-ins that can support things like Google Analytics, comments
on blog posts, SEO, etc.
- It's lightweight and fast
- And one of my favourites: you are in control, no third party ads (unless you
configure it yourself), and you decide what to do and what not without forcing
you to pay for that control.

# Cons
- If you don't have a technical background, the learning curve will be a bit steeper
as familiarity with git repositories, ruby and command-line tools is required.
But I can guarantee it is very simple.
- Usually you need to rely on third party tools for things like comments (e.g.
[Disqus](https://disqus.com/)). Although integration can be very simple as
mentioned in the pros, how much do you want to relay on third party services?
- There's no image manipulation/optimisation tool integrated.
- Although hosting is free with GitHub pages, the repository will still be public
unless you get a paid subscription with GitHub.

# Conclusion
If you're a tech savvy person looking for a simple and lightweight technology for
your blog or website, Jekyll is definitely worth a try.
